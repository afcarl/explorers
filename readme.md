## explorers - an exploration library for sensorimotor enviroments

The `explorers` library implements a framework for scientific research of exploration algorithms in sensorimotor spaces, in particular robotics. It allows to express motor and goal babbling algorithms, as well as *reuse* algorithms.

The `explorers` python package implements the exploration strategies, and is designed to work with the [`environments`](https://github.com/humm/environments) and [`learners`](https://github.com/humm/learners) packages.

If you use the `explorers` library in your research, don't hesitate to contact the owner of this repository for any question, and so your paper can be referenced here. Please also respect the terms of the *OpenScience* licence.


### Requirements

* **Required**: The [`forest`](https://github.com/flowersteam/forest) and [`numpy`](http://www.numpy.org/) package.
* **Recommended**: The [`learners`](https://github.com/humm/learners) for most goal babbling algorithms and the [`environments`](https://github.com/humm/environments) package for most examples.
* **Optional**: The [`bokeh`](http://bokeh.pydata.org/) plotting library for some examples.


### Design Overview

An motor signal is a dictionary of named channels with scalar values:

```python
m_signal = {'joint1': 0.5, 'joint2': 1.0}
```

An sensory signal is dictionaries, with keys as name of sensory channels, and scalar values as activation strength of each channel.

```python
s_signal = {'x': 34.2, 'y': 25.1}
```

An environment receives and execute motor signals. For instance, in a robot, the environment includes everything beyond the sensorimotor signal interface, including the body of the robot.

```python
class Environment(object):

    def execute(self, m_signal):
        return s_signal
```

An exploration algorithm decides which motor signals to send to the environment, and receives sensory signals.

```python
class Explorer(object):

    def explore(self):
        """Produce an motor signal"""
        exploration = {'m_signal': m_signal}
        # we can add metadata to this dictionary, such as uuid, timestamp, etc.
        return exploration

    def receive(self, exploration, feedback):
        """Update the internal model and state of the explorer"""
        m_signal = exploration['m_signal']
        s_signal = feedback['s_signal']
        # ...
```

Time is ordering all that together.

```python
for t in time:
    exploration = explorer.explore()
    feedback = environment.execute(exploration['m_signal'])
    explorer.receive(exploration, feedback)
```
