A exploration algorithm library for science

### Design Overview

An motor order is a dictionary of channels with given values

```python
order = {'joint1': 0.5, 'joint2': 1.0, 'speed': 10.0}
```

An environmental feedback is a list of dictionaries, with keys as sensory channels, and values as activation strength of each channel. Dictionnary represent arbitrary grouping of channels (examples x, y and z positions for an object). The channels are not apriori known in advance.

```python
feedback = [{'toy_x': 34.2, 'toy_y': 25.1}, {'light_intensity': 303.7}]
```

An environment execute motor orders. We make no distinction between the body the explorer controls and the rest of the environment.

```python
class Environment(object):

    def execute(self, order):
        return feedback
```

An exploration algorithm decides which order to execute on the environment, and receives the environmental feedback.

```python
class Explorer(object):

    def receive(self, feedback):
        pass

    def explore(self):
        return goal
```

Time is ordering all that together.

```python
for t in time:
    order = explorer.explore()
    explorer.receive(environment.execute(order))
```
